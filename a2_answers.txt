[3.1]
For part 3.2 where we have to find a path from city A to B, we can use a directed graph where each node
represents a unique city, and each directed edge represents a route from the source city to destination city.
Since there are no expenses being taken into account for this part, our graph will be unweighted. To find a
path from city A to B, we can simply use breadth-first search or depth-first search. 

For part 3.4 where we take into account meal expenses and must find the shortest and most cost-effective route, 
we can use a directed weighted graph where each node represents a unique city. Each directed edge from city A to B
will represent the cost of a single meal in a restaurant in city B. For example, let's say city B has 2 restaurants, 
called X and Y. Restaurant X has 2 meals, M1 and M2, and restaurant Y has 1 meal, M1. Then there will be 3 directed 
edges from city A to B as follows: Restaurant X M1, Restaurant X M2, and Restaurant Y M1. Each of these edges will
have the weight of the cost of the corresponding meal. Once we traverse the graph, we must make sure we don't take two
consecutive paths with the same meals.
